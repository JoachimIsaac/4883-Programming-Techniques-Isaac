### Description:
However, in this problem, you have to build a software that can calculate the donations. Initially
the total amount of money is 0 and in each time, two types of operations will be there.
1) ‘donate K’ (100 ≤ K ≤ 105
), then you have to add K to the account.
2) ‘report’, report all the money currently in the account.

We need these files to read from the input and to generate the result.txt files.
UVA online only accepts the output for python when you print it to the screen and not a file .


To get it accepted on UVA you need to comment these out:

--> sys.stdin = open('input1.txt', 'r')


--> sys.stdout = open('result1.txt', 'w')
