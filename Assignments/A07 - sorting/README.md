## 612 - DNA Sorting

### Joachim Isaac 


### Description:

One measure of “unsortedness” in a sequence is the number of pairs of entries that are out of order
with respect to each other. For instance, in the letter sequence “DAABEC”, this measure is 5, since D is
greater than four letters to its right and E is greater than one letter to its right. This measure is called
the number of inversions in the sequence. The sequence “AACEDGG” has only one inversion (E and D) —
it is nearly sorted — while the sequence “ZWQM” has 6 inversions (it is as unsorted as can be — exactly
the reverse of sorted).

You are responsible for cataloguing a sequence of DNA strings (sequences containing only the four
letters A, C, G, and T). However, you want to catalog them, not in alphabetical order, but rather in
order of “sortedness”, from “most sorted” to “least sorted”. All the strings are of the same length.
